## Tutorspoint

Tutorspoint

* A desktop application to stream videos. Users can login as teachers or students. Teachers have the privilege of uploading videos while both can stream videos.

* Like any social network, users can like and comment on the videos. They can also tags and categories in the videos accordingly. 

* Search is supported on the basis of uploader, tags and category.

* Categories are also sorted by rating, hence showing a rough analysis of the categories of the videos.

### How to use the application?

* Be sure to have Servlet Container (eg I used Apache Tomcat) installed on your machine. 

* Since I have used derby, you'll first have to run Apache Derby and have the database set up. You can use any other database of your choice, just make sure to set it up.

* Now you're good to go.
